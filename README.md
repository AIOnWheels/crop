# Crop Disease Detection
This repository holds the work on crop disease detection using Computer Vision Image Classification. This is experimental work intended to support Agri-Tech scenario

### Important Links 
- Dataset : https://github.com/spMohanty/PlantVillage-Dataset

### Exploratory Data Analysis on Images
- Find duplicate images using hamming distance 
- Find the resolution of the images and its distribution to check consistencies
- You can also check the aspect ratio of the images
- Find the channels distribution
- Find the class distribution across images 
- Find the brightness distribution in the images 
- Find the distriution of pixel per class
- Contrast between average images 
- You can use eigenimages to identify the defining part of the images
